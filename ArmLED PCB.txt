Features:
* Pico-EZmate Connectors for the LEDs
* Three voltage regulators
* Arduino Nano
* 3 Rotary encoders for Control
* 7 Analog pads for modifications


Voltage Regulator
        The voltage regulator’s maximum current output is 4A. 
        The VR chip is a switching regulator that switches at a frequency of 500kHz.
        It takes in 12V and outputs 5V.
        The first voltage regulator connects to the arduino and the starting LEDs connector.


Rotary Encoders
        The rotary encoders act as controllers for the arduino.
        I preferred them over potentiometers and DIP switches because they allow for more control with less pins.
